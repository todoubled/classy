# BullShit Detector

This was developed with politics in mind, but can be used to train and detect any type of textual bullshit.

Politics are bullshit and I wanted to find a way to quantify that.

When planning your bullshit detector, break down the anticipated bullshit into classification types.
Then add a 1-sentence example of each bullshit type in a text file with the same name in ```classifications/```
