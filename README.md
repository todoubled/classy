# Classy
Classify transcripts with classification keywords.


## Usage
Create classification text files with comma delimited keywords to classify text transcripts.

See ```examples/``` for a bullshit detector.
```make setup``` to install dependencies and ```make classify``` to test sample political transcripts for bullshit.


### Story
This was developed with politics in mind, but can be used to train and classify any type of text.
Politics are bullshit and I wanted to find a way to quantify that.


### TODO
- Measure keyword density
- Capture derivatives of keywords
- Score classifications on a curve
